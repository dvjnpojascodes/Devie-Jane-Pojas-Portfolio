                <p id="desc">
                    The Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Institute of technology registrar as any other registrars has 
                    a lot of responsibilities. Among other things, they are responsible for dealing with the students’ and staffs’ 
                    academic and professional lives, safeguarding student data and supporting and building student-led courses. 
                    Along with this responsibility, is the problem about poor queue management system in the university. Thereby, 
                    PUP was labeled as Pila-Ulit-Pibecause of the long process of queuing in registrar. Considering all these problems. Through the POLYQUEUE- Queuing Technology System, the university registrar will not only improve their queuing service but also achieve student satisfaction because the queuing process will be faster, organized and free from congestion.

            <p id="list">
                <span id="bold">Increased the efficiency of PUP-Itech registrar. </span> POLYQUEUE's ultimate goal is efficiency. Users want to
                accomplish as much as possible in the shortest amount of
                time possible. Increases productivity while lowering costs
                and workload. The POLYQUEUE will help minimize the time-consuming distractions associated with
                managing visitors and students throughout the day.<br>
            </p>

            <p id="list">
                <span id="bold">Reduced Waiting Periods. </span> The combination of increased
                registrar efficiency and shorter, more productive contacts in
                a POLYQUEUE reduces the amount of time users wait for
                their turn. <br>
            </p>
            <p id="list">
                <span id="bold">Increase registrar’s satisfaction. </span> Majority of registrars
                prefer to communicate with contented, less concerned
                customers, which a POLYQUEUE want to facilitate. IT will also help assure
                student,visitor,and PUP-Itech registrar staff happiness
                and reduce their complaints and frustrations to provide a
                pleasant queue experience. Both of these consequences can
                result to registrars feeling more fulfilled and connected to
                their professions. <br>

                    The active queue section will allow the registrar to oversee the following clients that are currently waiting in line. Furthermore, the dashboard section also shows the summary of how many queue there are today, how many missed their schedule, and how many were already served.

                Furthermore, the reports section will also show summary of time duration of service on that day, the total queues, how many did not come or missed the queue, and how many were served.

        <p>I combined a variety of shades of maroon, gray, and white to represent PUP-Itech’s brand. This is to let the users know that the system is by PUP when they are using it. When designing the user interface of Polyqueue, I  make sure that it is direct to the point, and user will understand what are the buttons and sections are for.  For typography, I utilized a bold font for headers, and use uniform font, Lato throughout the system. This allows for a cleaner and more modern feel while using the system.</p>

        <p id="sub-title">Notes and Takeaways</p>
        <p id="desc">
            This project took four weeks to ideate and design. During the ideation
            process, our group discuss thoroughly how the features will help the 
            users of Polyqueue. This project taught me to work in a group and share
             our own ideas to analyze what should be and shouldn’t be on the system’s 
             features. Many features weren't displayed in this case study, including 
             the website wireframe for client’s side. This project, although it is 
             just an activity in school was a huge learning experience for me in 
             designing an user interface and do a thorough research first to provide an
             easy and good experience for users, such as proper use of words and placement
             of buttons.
